# Vehicle_Indoor_Air_Quality_prediction


This code calculates the Air Quality Index (AQI) from air quality data. The AQI is a measure of how polluted the air is, and it is used to inform people about the health risks associated with air pollution.

The code first calculates the sub-index for each pollutant (PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, CO, and O3). The sub-index is a number between 0 and 50, and it represents the level of pollution for each pollutant.

The AQI is then calculated by taking the maximum sub-index. The AQI is also bucketed into six categories: Good, Satisfactory, Moderate, Poor, Very Poor, and Severe.

The code also plots the relationship between the AQI and PM2.5. This plot can be used to see how the AQI changes as the PM2.5 level increases.
